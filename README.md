Vectors is a lightweight set of typed collection utilities for PHP that make working with strings, tokens, enums, and
exceptions concise and safe. It provides purpose-built vector classes with fluent APIs for appending values, normalizing
input, and enforcing uniqueness, plus consistent array accessors for easy interoperability. Token-focused vectors help
you parse and manage delimited string tokens, while enum-aware vectors can organize cases, names, and values with
predictable sorting. Provider interfaces let your domain objects expose their data as vectors directly, keeping
collection logic centralized and reusable. Use it to tame adâ€‘hoc arrays into explicit, self-documenting structures that
are straightforward to validate, transform, and pass around.
